# This is My Office
This is the branch where I will house all the local files in my Project Loona folder. It contains a lot of uneeded shit, including the code for the game I'm making with Loona.
## And My Laboratory
When I get to a point that I'm happy with the code I've written and I want to commit to the main branch, I'll only commit the Loona Engine files, keeping my game separate.
